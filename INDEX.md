# INDEX — Paradigm-Shift Fleet Officer

This index is a **curated navigation surface**, not an exhaustive listing.

It highlights projects, paradigms, and structures that are ready for inspection or checkout.  
Absence from this index does **not** imply inactivity or irrelevance.

## Design Projects (Check-outable)

> Modular system designs intended to be implemented **outside** this repository under separate authority.

- **Project Template**  
  *Status:* template

## Paradigms & Invariants

> Conceptual shifts, invariants, and reframings that inform system design.

- **Governance by Architecture**  
  *Status:* concept  
  Safety and coordination emerge from enforced boundaries, not belief or intent.

  *Status:* concept  
  Authority must be bounded, revocable, and auditable as identity signals erode.

- Entries are added **only** when ready for human or agent reuse
- One-line descriptions only
- Status must be explicit (template / concept / draft / stable)
- This file is intentionally minimal
