# How to Add a New Project

This checklist applies to both human contributors and agents.

---

## Step 1 — Idea Intake
- Place the idea in `notes/in-progress/`
- Do not create a project folder yet

---

## Step 2 — Clarify the Idea
Confirm:
- the problem being addressed
- the boundary of responsibility
- what is explicitly out of scope

If these are unclear, the idea stays in `notes/`.

---

## Step 3 — Promote to Project
When ready:
- Copy `projects/project-template/`
- Rename the folder to a clear, descriptive name
- Complete `README.md`, `INTENT.md`, and `CHECKOUT.md`

---

## Step 4 — Indexing
- Add a short entry to `INDEX.md`
- Include:
  - project name
  - one-line description
  - status (concept / draft / stable)

---

## Step 5 — Final Check
Before considering the project complete:
- No executable code present
- No implied authority
- No actuation pathways
- Clear separation between design and execution

---

## Rule of Thumb

> If someone could misunderstand this project repo as a command surface, the project is not ready.
