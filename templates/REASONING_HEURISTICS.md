# Reasoning Heuristics & Shared Defaults

This document captures **jointly established reasoning heuristics** that guide how work is classified, promoted, indexed, or intentionally left un-amplified in this repository.

It is not a log of conversations.
It is a **compressed memory of settled understanding**, intended to prevent re-litigation of the same questions by humans or agents unless explicitly revised.

These heuristics should be treated as **default assumptions**, not hard law. They remain in force unless the user explicitly contradicts or modifies them.

---

## Purpose

This file exists to:
- preserve hard-won conceptual clarity
- avoid reinventing reasoning patterns
- align agent behavior with user intent *without* continuous re-explanation
- make decision rationale legible without storing transcripts

It records *how decisions are made*, not *what decisions were made*.

---

## Heuristic 1 — Classification by Function

When deciding where new material belongs:

- If it explains **why something matters** → `paradigms/`
- If it sketches **how something might be structured or built** → `notes/in-progress/`
- If it is safe for reuse and implementation elsewhere → `projects/`
- If it defines **how to contribute or reason consistently** → `templates/`

When in doubt, choose the **least authoritative location**.

---

## Heuristic 2 — Indexing Rule (Concise)

> Index something only if a stranger could safely treat it as intentional.

If indexing would:
- over-amplify
- encourage cargo-culting
- imply endorsement or readiness

…then the item should exist **without being indexed**.

---

## Heuristic 3 — Indexing Rule (Expanded)

An item should be indexed **only if all three conditions are true**:

1. It is deliberate enough to stand on its own without contextual explanation.
2. It is meant to be discovered early rather than stumbled upon later.
3. Misinterpretation would be more harmful than omission.

Indexing is about **legibility under time pressure**, not importance.

---

## Heuristic 4 — Promotion Discipline

Material should move *up* the structure only when it changes in kind:

- notes → projects: when scope, boundaries, and non-goals are explicit
- notes → paradigms: when invariants are articulated and detached from implementation

Promotion is a structural act, not a reward.

---

## Heuristic 5 — Defaults vs. Reconfirmation

Unless explicitly contradicted:
- previously established reasoning patterns may be reused
- agents may assume these defaults still apply

However:
- silence does not imply permission to extend scope
- reuse does not imply authority to optimize

Defaults decay only when replaced, not when forgotten.

---

## Heuristic 6 — Compression Over Completeness

This repository favors:
- summaries over transcripts
- invariants over anecdotes
- structure over history

If a concept can be re-derived from an invariant, it should not be logged verbatim.

---

## Heuristic 7 — When to Stop

If further refinement would:
- reduce optionality
- increase implied authority
- or make action easier than thinking

…then the correct move is to **pause or contain**, not advance.

---

## Status

- Canonical
- Non-executable
- Applies to both humans and agents
- May be revised only with explicit user intent
